# Store-Manager

This is a project I did back in 2014. The main idea of this application is to manage stores and suplies in all stores. Because it's an older project I don't have anymore the database. It would take some time to recreate it from the code and I will try to do it when I find some free time and also translate it to English.

In the application there are 3 interfaces in which the user can login depending on his credentials.

First interface is for the main warehouse where the warehouse manager can see the suplies in all stores and if he sees that some store is low in suply for some product it can send more to the store. The warehouse manager can also add new stores and new employees in the system. He can also see the total financial situaton of a single store or all stores, be it this month or previous months. 

Second interfase is for store managers. It allows the store manager to add new employees to his store or change the information of current ones, to add new products or change information of current ones and to see the total revenue of his store.

Third interface is for the cashiers, it allows them to scan products and print the bill.
